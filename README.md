# 🍕 Pizza Image Classification

## 📌 Description  
This project focuses on **image classification** using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch to distinguish between **pizza** and **non-pizza** images. The model is trained on the `pizza-not-pizza` dataset from Kaggle, with a carefully designed CNN to achieve high accuracy in binary classification.

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **CNN model built from scratch**
- ✅ **Multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling layers**  
- ✅ **Binary classification with Sigmoid activation**  
- ✅ **Performance evaluation** with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix  
- ✅ **Export to multiple formats** including `.keras`, `.tflite`, and TensorFlow.js  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.11**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn**  
- **KaggleHub**

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
- 📂 `carlosrunner/pizza-not-pizza`  
- 🔸 **Pizza** 🍕 — images containing pizza  
- 🔸 **Not Pizza** ❌ — images of non-pizza objects  
- 🖼️ Grayscale images, resized to **256x256 pixels**  

## 💾 Outputs  
- ✅ `pizza_model.keras`  
- ✅ `saved_model_tf/`  
- ✅ `model.tflite`  
- ✅ `tfjs_model/`

## ✨ Acknowledgements  
Special thanks to the Kaggle community for providing the dataset, and to TensorFlow for making deep learning accessible for learners and developers everywhere.
